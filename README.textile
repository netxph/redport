h1. redport

First release has reached 1.6, and 2.0 is on its way.

visit "redport-beta.heroku.com":http://redport-beta.heroku.com to preview the version 1.6.

h2. What will come on first alpha release of the next version (2.0)

I am still on conceptual stage as of this moment. If you want to get the previous version, switch to release-1.0 branch.

Without further ado, here's what I'm planning to do on my first release.

* Look for a solid test framework, strict implementation this time
* Thinking of a good white layout design for my site
* HTML 5 animations
* coffescript, ajax, jquery. Getting pretty excited.

I'm still thinking where to put my project management site. Gravity or Lighthouse.

That's it for now. Follow me on twitter for live updates. #netxph.
